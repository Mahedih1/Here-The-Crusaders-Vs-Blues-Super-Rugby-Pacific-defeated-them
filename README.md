The Crusaders Vs Blues have met 42 times since the dawn of Super Rugby. The Crusaders have won 32 matches, the Blues 12 and one match ended in a draw. The Crusaders have an incredible historical record, having won 17 of the last 18 games.
The rivalry is defined by hard-fought games, memorable playoffs and a trace of bad blood, jumbled in with occasional respect. Notably, the Crusaders defeated the Blues in the final at Eden Park in 2022 to win their 11th Super Rugby title. This brought the Blues’ long winning streak to an end.
Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo’unga are key players in these matches, and their head-to-head battles are closely watched and greatly influence the outcome of the games.
Stats & Performace of the Team for 2025:
More telling, in the last five matches, the Crusaders had more: runs (1048-982), meters gained (3684-3656), clean breaks (66–41), defenders beat (215–162) and tackles (1330–1400: Admittedly, the Crusaders were a touch more disciplined, mistake-wise).
The tactical discipline and effective game approaches implemented by a coach staff led by Rob Penney have contributed to their recent successes.
In short:
The Crusaders have their measure in 2025, the champs winning all previous exhibitions between the two groups with it being a walkover each time. Super Rugby Pacific’s inherent competition and high stakes have made the matches physically demanding, strategically complicated and emotionally intense. Sure, the Crusaders have won more games in general and more recently, but the Blues are still a test, the type of side who can challenge their dominance
