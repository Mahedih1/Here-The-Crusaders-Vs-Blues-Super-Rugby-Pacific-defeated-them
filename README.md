The rivalry between the Blues and Crusaders has been fierce and historic in Super Rugby Pacific 2025. Both teams have shown their strengths and fighting spirits in recent games.
Details of a recent match:
Crusaders Vs Blues
On March 22, 2025, the Crusaders defeated the Blues 42–19 at Eden Park. The Crusaders won because they played great offense. Some of the six tries were scored by players such as Chay Fihaki, Kyle Preston, and Sevu Reece, before Taha Kemara converted a few. The Blues scored two tries: one each to Dalton Papalii and Finlay Christie. But the Crusaders' superior technique masked their work rate. Overall, the Crusaders won the game because they had more runs, meters, clean breaks, defenders beaten and stops than the Blues.
April 1, 2025 Crusaders 42–19 Blues Eden Park They had a full game, with multiple tries, good set piece management, and intelligent kicking. There were three key moments earlier in the game when Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece, and Tom Christie made big plays which put the Crusaders ahead. The Blues scrapped hard but they were unable to cope with the onslaught from the Crusaders attacking line. In the end, it was an easy game for the Crusaders.
On March 19, 2025, they traveled to Eden Park, where they faced the Blues and took a 41–19 victory. Both teams registered tries in the match, but the Crusaders showed remarkable clinical finishing and steady defense. It was the Blues who opened the scoring, but they struggled to match the relentless assault of the Crusaders, led by Fihaki, Williams and Havili.
Context and contrast in history:
The Crusaders Vs Blues have met 42 times since the dawn of Super Rugby. The Crusaders have won 32 matches, the Blues 12 and one match ended in a draw. The Crusaders have an incredible historical record, having won 17 of the last 18 games.
The rivalry is defined by hard-fought games, memorable playoffs and a trace of bad blood, jumbled in with occasional respect. Notably, the Crusaders defeated the Blues in the final at Eden Park in 2022 to win their 11th Super Rugby title. This brought the Blues’ long winning streak to an end.
Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo’unga are key players in these matches, and their head-to-head battles are closely watched and greatly influence the outcome of the games.
Stats & Performace of the Team for 2025:
More telling, in the last five matches, the Crusaders had more: runs (1048-982), meters gained (3684-3656), clean breaks (66–41), defenders beat (215–162) and tackles (1330–1400: Admittedly, the Crusaders were a touch more disciplined, mistake-wise).
The tactical discipline and effective game approaches implemented by a coach staff led by Rob Penney have contributed to their recent successes.
In short:
The Crusaders have their measure in 2025, the champs winning all previous exhibitions between the two groups with it being a walkover each time. Super Rugby Pacific’s inherent competition and high stakes have made the matches physically demanding, strategically complicated and emotionally intense. Sure, the Crusaders have won more games in general and more recently, but the Blues are still a test, the type of side who can challenge their dominance
